| **Winston**        | Logging library used for structured API request/response logs      |
| **dotenv**         | Loads environment variables from a `.env` file                     |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automates test execution on every push/PR to the `main` branch     |

## ü§ñ API Clients Rationale

All 4 core APIs were implemented as modular classes to ensure:
- üîÅ Reusability
- üßπ Separation of concerns
- ‚öôÔ∏è Scalable and maintainable test structure

| API Class          | Responsibility                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `UserApi`          | Retrieve and update user balance                    |
| `GameApi`          | Perform game spins                                  |
| `PaymentApi`       | Handle bet placement and payout logic               |
| `NotificationApi`  | Send user notifications after each spin             |

All classes utilize Playwright's `APIRequestContext` for HTTP interactions.

## Assumptions

- The backend server is accessible locally on `http://localhost:3000` and supports all required endpoints.
- The user ID used for testing has a sufficient initial balance.
- Endpoints follow expected contract:
  - `/slot/spin` returns an outcome of either `"WIN"` or `"LOSE"`
  - `/payment/payout` is called only on win, and the `winAmount` matches the spin result
  - Notifications are always expected after every spin

---

## Running the Tests Locally

### Option 1: Windows Users - Using `run-tests.bat`

You can either double-click the `run-tests.bat` script, or run it directly from your terminal:

This will:

- Run all Playwright tests  
- Generate a fresh Allure report  
- Open the report automatically in your default browser  

If you‚Äôre on Linux and need a `.sh` script ‚Äî let me know, I can create one.

---

### Option 2: Manual Run (Cross-platform)

Run the following commands manually in your terminal:

npx playwright test
npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
npx allure open allure-report

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

## GitHub CI/CD Integration

A full GitHub Actions workflow is included:

- Triggered on every push or pull request to the `main` branch  
- Installs dependencies and Playwright browsers  
- Executes the full test suite  
- Generates Allure report  
- Uploads Allure report as downloadable artifact  

You can view results in GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab ‚Üí latest run ‚Üí download allure report

## üìÇ `.env` Configuration

A `.env` file is included to allow flexible environment setup:

```env
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
USER_ID=123
BET_AMOUNT=10
